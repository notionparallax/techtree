This is a graph of the things we thought we might need to do to achieve a wild and unrealistic dream.

It's driven by an [airtable](https://airtable.com/tblqnuwwhDgvM0bL1/viwnhHU4C2hN1lUam)

At the moment it's broken, and is just showing the most basic DOT rendering. It should be showing the project teams and the completion rates of the projects, as well as some natty slide decks for each node. _C'est la vie_ maybe one day it'll get fixed.
